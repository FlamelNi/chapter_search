Temperature; Thermometers Temperature is an SI base
quantity related to our sense of hot and cold. It is measured with a
thermometer, which contains a working substance with a measurable
property, such as length or pressure, that changes in a regular
way as the substance becomes hotter or colder.
Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics When a thermometer and
some other object are placed in contact with each other, they eventually
reach thermal equilibrium.The reading of the thermometer is
then taken to be the temperature of the other object. The process
provides consistent and useful temperature measurements because
of the zeroth law of thermodynamics: If bodies A and B are each in
thermal equilibrium with a third body C (the thermometer), then A
and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
The Kelvin Temperature Scale In the SI system, temperature
is measured on the Kelvin scale, which is based on the triple
point of water (273.16 K). Other temperatures are then defined by

Thermal Expansion All objects change size with changes in temperature.
For a temperature change %T, a change %L in any linear
dimensionLis given by
%L # La %T, (18-9)
in which a is the coefficient of linear expansion. The change %V in
the volume V of a solid or liquid is
%V # Vb %T. (18-10)
Here b # 3a is the material’s coefficient of volume expansion.
Heat Heat Q is energy that is transferred between a system and
its environment because of a temperature difference between
them. It can be measured in joules (J), calories (cal), kilocalories
(Cal or kcal), or British thermal units (Btu), with
1 cal # 3.968 ' 10$3 Btu # 4.1868 J. (18-12)
Heat Capacity and Specific Heat If heat Q is absorbed by
an object, the object’s temperature change Tf $ Ti is related to Qby
Q # C(Tf $ Ti), (18-13)
in which C is the heat capacity of the object. If the object has mass
m, then
Q # cm(Tf $ Ti), (18-14)
where c is the specific heat of the material making up the object.
The molar specific heat of a material is the heat capacity
per mole, which means per 6.02 ' 1023 elementary units of the
material.
Heat of Transformation Matter can exist in three common
states: solid, liquid, and vapor. Heat absorbed by a material may
change the material’s physical state—for example, from solid to liquid
or from liquid to gas.The amount of energy required per unit mass
to change the state (but not the temperature) of a particular material
is its heat of transformationL.Thus,
Q # Lm. (18-16)
The heat of vaporization LV is the amount of energy per unit mass
that must be added to vaporize a liquid or that must be removed to
condense a gas. The heat of fusion LF is the amount of energy per
unit mass that must be added to melt a solid or that must be removed
to freeze a liquid.
Work Associated with Volume Change A gas may
exchange energy with its surroundings through work. The amount
of work W done by a gas as it expands or contracts from an initial
volume Vi to a final volume Vf is given by
W # (18-25) "dW # "Vf
Vi
p dV.
The integration is necessary because the pressure p may vary during
the volume change.
First Law of Thermodynamics The principle of conservation
of energy for a thermodynamic process is expressed in the
first law of thermodynamics, which may assume either of the
forms
%Eint # Eint,f $ Eint,i # Q $ W (first law) (18-26)
or dEint # dQ $ dW (first law). (18-27)
Eint represents the internal energy of the material, which depends
only on the material’s state (temperature, pressure, and volume).
Q represents the energy exchanged as heat between the system
and its surroundings; Q is positive if the system absorbs heat and
negative if the system loses heat. W is the work done by the system;
W is positive if the system expands against an external force
from the surroundings and negative if the system contracts because
of an external force. Q and W are path dependent; %Eint is
path independent.
Applications of the First Law The first law of thermodynamics
finds application in several special cases:
adiabatic processes: Q # 0, %Eint#$W
constant-volume processes: W # 0, %Eint # Q
cyclical processes: %Eint # 0, Q # W
free expansions: Q # W#%Eint # 0
Conduction, Convection, and Radiation The rate Pcond at
which energy is conducted through a slab for which one face is
maintained at the higher temperature TH and the other face is
maintained at the lower temperature TC is
(18-32)
Here each face of the slab has area A, the length of the slab (the
distance between the faces) is L, and k is the thermal conductivity
of the material.
Convection occurs when temperature differences cause an energy
transfer by motion within a fluid.
Radiation is an energy transfer via the emission of electromagnetic
energy. The rate Prad at which an object emits energy via thermal
radiation is
Prad # s´AT4, (18-38)
where s (# 5.6704 ' 10$8 W/m2 9K4) is the Stefan – Boltzmann
constant, ´ is the emissivity of the object’s surface, A is its surface
area, and T is its surface temperature (in kelvins). The rate Pabs at
which an object absorbs energy via thermal radiation from its environment,
which is at the uniform temperature Tenv (in kelvins), is

One-Way Processes An irreversible process is one that cannot
be reversed by means of small changes in the environment.The
direction in which an irreversible process proceeds is set by the
change in entropy %S of the system undergoing the process.
Entropy S is a state property (or state function) of the system; that
is, it depends only on the state of the system and not on the way in
which the system reached that state. The entropy postulate states (in
part): If an irreversible process occurs in a closed system, the entropy
of the system always increases.
Calculating Entropy Change The entropy change %S for an
irreversible process that takes a system from an initial state i to a
final state f is exactly equal to the entropy change %S for any reversible
process that takes the system between those same two
states.We can compute the latter (but not the former) with
(20-1)
Here Q is the energy transferred as heat to or from the system during
the process, and T is the temperature of the system in kelvins
during the process.
For a reversible isothermal process,Eq. 20-1 reduces to
(20-2)
When the temperature change %T of a system is small relative to
the temperature (in kelvins) before and after the process, the entropy
change can be approximated as
(20-3)
whereTavg is the system’s average temperature during the process.
When an ideal gas changes reversibly from an initial state with

Review & Summary
The Second Law of Thermodynamics This law, which is
an extension of the entropy postulate, states: If a process occurs in
a closed system, the entropy of the system increases for irreversible
processes and remains constant for reversible processes. It never decreases.
In equation form,
%S 0 0. (20-5)
Engines An engine is a device that, operating in a cycle, extracts
energy as heat +QH+ from a high-temperature reservoir and does a certain
amount of work +W+.The efficiency ´ of any engine is defined as
(20-11)
In an ideal engine, all processes are reversible and no wasteful energy
transfers occur due to, say, friction and turbulence.A Carnot engine is
an ideal engine that follows the cycle of Fig. 20-9. Its efficiency is
(20-12, 20-13)
in which TH and TL are the temperatures of the high- and lowtemperature
reservoirs, respectively. Real engines always have an
efficiency lower than that given by Eq. 20-13. Ideal engines that are
not Carnot engines also have lower efficiencies.
A perfect engine is an imaginary engine in which energy extracted
as heat from the high-temperature reservoir is converted completely
to work. Such an engine would violate the second law of thermodynamics,
which can be restated as follows: No series of processes
is possible whose sole result is the absorption of energy as heat from a
thermal reservoir and the complete conversion of this energy to work.
Refrigerators A refrigerator is a device that, operating in a cycle,
has work W done on it as it extracts energy +QL+ as heat from a
low-temperature reservoir. The coefficient of performance K of a
refrigerator is defined as

For a Carnot refrigerator,Eq. 20-14 becomes
(20-15, 20-16)
A perfect refrigerator is an imaginary refrigerator in which
energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature reservoir is converted
completely to heat discharged to the high-temperature reservoir,
without any need for work. Such a refrigerator would violate
the second law of thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows:
No series of processes is possible whose sole result is the transfer of
energy as heat from a reservoir at a given temperature to a reservoir
at a higher temperature.
Entropy from a Statistical View The entropy of a system can
be defined in terms of the possible distributions of its molecules. For
identical molecules, each possible distribution of molecules is called a
microstate of the system.All equivalent microstates are grouped into

a configuration of the system.The number of microstates in a configuration
is the multiplicityWof the configuration.
For a system of N molecules that may be distributed between
the two halves of a box, the multiplicity is given by
(20-20)
in which n1 is the number of molecules in one half of the box and n2 is
the number in the other half. A basic assumption of statistical
mechanics is that all the microstates are equally probable.Thus, configurations
with a large multiplicity occur most often.
The multiplicity W of a configuration of a system and the entropy
S of the system in that configuration are related by
Boltzmann’s entropy equation:
S # k ln W, (20-21)
where k # 1.38 ' 10$23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant.

••32 A Carnot engine is set up to produce a certain work W - -
per cycle. In each cycle, energy in the form of heat QH is
transferred to the working substance of the engine from
the higher-temperature thermal reservoir, which is at an adjustable
temperature TH.The lower-temperature thermal reservoir is maintained
at temperature TL # 250 K. Figure 20-28 gives QH for a
range of TH. The scale of the vertical axis is set by QHs#6.0 kJ. If
TH is set at 550 K, what is QH?
