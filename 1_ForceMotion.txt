Newtonian Mechanics The velocity of an object can change
(the object can accelerate) when the object is acted on by one or
more forces (pushes or pulls) from other objects. Newtonian mechanics
relates accelerations and forces.
Force Forces are vector quantities. Their magnitudes are defined
in terms of the acceleration they would give the standard
kilogram. A force that accelerates that standard body by exactly
1 m/s2 is defined to have a magnitude of 1 N. The direction of a
force is the direction of the acceleration it causes. Forces are combined
according to the rules of vector algebra. The net force on a
body is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the body.
Newton’s First Law If there is no net force on a body, the
body remains at rest if it is initially at rest or moves in a straight
line at constant speed if it is in motion.
Inertial Reference Frames Reference frames in which
Newtonian mechanics holds are called inertial reference frames or
inertial frames. Reference frames in which Newtonian mechanics
does not hold are called noninertial reference frames or noninertial
frames.
Mass The mass of a body is the characteristic of that body that
relates the body’s acceleration to the net force causing the acceleration.
Masses are scalar quantities.
Newton’s Second Law The net force on a body with
mass m is related to the body’s acceleration by
(5-1)

A free-body diagram is a stripped-down diagram in which only
one body is considered. That body is represented by either a sketch or
a dot. The external forces on the body are drawn, and a coordinate
system is superimposed, oriented so as to simplify the solution.
Some Particular Forces A gravitational force on a body
is a pull by another body. In most situations in this book, the other
body is Earth or some other astronomical body. For Earth, the
force is directed down toward the ground, which is assumed to be
an inertial frame. With that assumption, the magnitude of is
Fg " mg, (5-8)
where m is the body’s mass and g is the magnitude of the free-fall
acceleration.
The weight W of a body is the magnitude of the upward force
needed to balance the gravitational force on the body. A body’s
weight is related to the body’s mass by
W " mg. (5-12)
A normal force is the force on a body from a surface
against which the body presses. The normal force is always perpendicular
to the surface.
A frictional force is the force on a body when the body
slides or attempts to slide along a surface. The force is always parallel
to the surface and directed so as to oppose the sliding. On a
frictionless surface, the frictional force is negligible.
When a cord is under tension, each end of the cord pulls on a
body. The pull is directed along the cord, away from the point of attachment
to the body. For a massless cord (a cord with negligible
mass), the pulls at both ends of the cord have the same magnitude
T, even if the cord runs around a massless, frictionless pulley (a pulley
with negligible mass and negligible friction on its axle to oppose
its rotation).
Newton’s Third Law If a force acts on body B due to
body C, then there is a force on body C due to body B

Friction When a force tends to slide a body along a surface, a
frictional force from the surface acts on the body.The frictional force
is parallel to the surface and directed so as to oppose the sliding. It is
due to bonding between the atoms on the body and the atoms on the
surface, an effect called cold-welding.
If the body does not slide, the frictional force is a static
frictional force . If there is sliding, the frictional force is a kinetic
frictional force .
1. If a body does not move, the static frictional force and the
component of parallel to the surface are equal in magnitude,
and is directed opposite that component. If the component
increases, fs also increases.
2. The magnitude of has a maximum value fs,max given by
fs,max " msFN, (6-1)
where ms is the coefficient of static friction and FN is the magnitude
of the normal force. If the component of parallel to the
surface exceeds fs,max, the static friction is overwhelmed and the
body slides on the surface.
3. If the body begins to slide on the surface, the magnitude of the
frictional force rapidly decreases to a constant value fk given
by
fk " mkFN, (6-2)
where mk is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Drag Force When there is relative motion between air (or
some other fluid) and a body, the body experiences a drag force
that opposes the relative motion and points in the direction in
which the fluid flows relative to the body. The magnitude of is D:

••38 Assume Eq. 6-14 gives the drag force on a pilot plus ejection
seat just after they are ejected from a plane traveling horizontally
at 1300 km/h. Assume also that the mass of the seat is equal to the
mass of the pilot and that the drag coefficient is that of a sky diver.

appropriate vt value from Table 6-1, estimate the magnitudes of
(a) the drag force on the pilot # seat and (b) their horizontal deceleration
(in terms of g), both just after ejection. (The result of

a protective barrier to deflect the initial wind blast away
from the pilot’s head.)
