Electric Charge The strength of a particle’s electrical interaction
with objects around it depends on its electric charge (usually represented
as q), which can be either positive or negative. Particles with
the same sign of charge repel each other, and particles with opposite
signs of charge attract each other. An object with equal amounts of
the two kinds of charge is electrically neutral, whereas one with an
imbalance is electrically charged and has an excess charge.
Conductors are materials in which a significant number of
electrons are free to move. The charged particles in nonconductors
(insulators) are not free to move.
Electric current i is the rate dq/dt at which charge passes a point:
(electric current). (21-3)
Coulomb’s Law Coulomb’s law describes the electrostatic
force (or electric force) between two charged particles. If the particles
have charges q1 and q2, are separated by distance r, and are at
rest (or moving only slowly) relative to each other, then the magnitude
of the force acting on each due to the other is given by
(Coulomb’s law), (21-4)
where is the permittivity constant. The
ratio 1/4p´0 is often replaced with the electrostatic constant (or
Coulomb constant) k # 8.99 ' 109N9m2/C2.
´0 # 8.85 ' 10$12C2/N9m2

The electrostatic force vector acting on a charged particle due
to a second charged particle is either directly toward the second
particle (opposite signs of charge) or directly away from it (same
sign of charge).As with other types of forces, if multiple electrostatic
forces act on a particle, the net force is the vector sum (not scalar
sum) of the individual forces.
The two shell theories for electrostatics are
Shell theorem 1: A charged particle outside a shell with charge
uniformly distributed on its surface is attracted or repelled as if
the shell’s charge were concentrated as a particle at its center.
Shell theorem 2: A charged particle inside a shell with charge
uniformly distributed on its surface has no net force acting on it
due to the shell.
Charge on a conducting spherical shell spreads uniformly over the
(external) surface.
The Elementary Charge Electric charge is quantized (restricted
to certain values). The charge of a particle can be written
as ne, where n is a positive or negative integer and e is the elementary
charge, which is the magnitude of the charge of the electron
and proton (% 1.602 ' 10$19 C).
Conservation of Charge The net electric charge of any isolated
system is always conserved.


Of the charge Q initially on a tiny sphere, a portion
q is to be transferred to a second, nearby sphere. Both spheres
can be treated as particles and are fixed with a certain separation.
For what value of q/Q will the electrostatic force between the two
spheres be maximized?

Identical isolated conducting spheres 1 and 2 have equal
charges and are separated by a distance that is large compared with
their diameters (Fig. 21-22a). The electrostatic force acting on
sphere 2 due to sphere 1 is . Suppose now that a third identical
sphere 3, having an insulating handle and initially neutral, is
touched first to sphere 1 (Fig. 21-22b), then to sphere 2 (Fig. 21-22c),
and finally removed (Fig. 21-22d). The electrostatic force that now
acts on sphere 2 has magnitude F,.What is the ratio F,/F?

Electric Field To explain the electrostatic force between two
charges, we assume that each charge sets up an electric field in the
space around it.The force acting on each charge is then due to the
electric field set up at its location by the other charge.
Definition of Electric Field The electric field at any point
is defined in terms of the electrostatic force that would be exerted
on a positive test charge q0 placed there:

Electric Field Lines Electric field lines provide a means for visualizing
the direction and magnitude of electric fields.The electric field
vector at any point is tangent to a field line through that point. The

Gauss’ Law Gauss’ law and Coulomb’s law are different ways
of describing the relation between charge and electric field in static
situations. Gauss’ law is
´0&$qenc (Gauss’ law), (23-6)
in which qenc is the net charge inside an imaginary closed surface (a
Gaussian surface) and & is the net flux of the electric field through
the surface:
(23-4)
Coulomb’s law can be derived from Gauss’ law.
Applications of Gauss’ Law Using Gauss’ law and, in some
cases, symmetry arguments, we can derive several important
results in electrostatic situations.Among these are:
1. An excess charge on an isolated conductor is located entirely on
the outer surface of the conductor.
2. The external electric field near the surface of a charged conductor
is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude that depends
on the surface charge density s:
(conducting surface). (23-11)

5. The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge with radius R

Here r is the distance from the center of the shell to the point at
which E is measured. (The charge behaves, for external points, as if
it were all located at the center of the sphere.) The field inside a

60 The chocolate crumb mystery. Explosions ignited by
electrostatic discharges (sparks) constitute a serious danger in facilities
handling grain or powder. Such an explosion occurred in
chocolate crumb powder at a biscuit factory in the 1970s.Workers
usually emptied newly delivered sacks of the powder into a loading
bin, from which it was blown through electrically grounded plastic
pipes to a silo for storage. Somewhere along this route, two conditions
for an explosion were met: (1) The magnitude of an electric
field became 3.0 ( 106 N/C or greater, so that electrical breakdown
and thus sparking could occur. (2) The energy of a spark was
150 mJ or greater so that it could ignite the powder explosively. Let
us check for the first condition in the powder flow through the
plastic pipes.

through a cylindrical pipe of radius R $ 5.0 cm. Assume that the
powder and its charge were spread uniformly through the pipe

Current An electric current i in a conductor is defined by
(26-1)
Here dq is the amount of (positive) charge that passes in time dt
through a hypothetical surface that cuts across the conductor. By
convention, the direction of electric current is taken as the direction
in which positive charge carriers would move. The SI unit of
electric current is the ampere (A): 1 A ! 1 C/s.
Current Density Current (a scalar) is related to current
density (a vector) by

and the integral is taken over any surface cutting across the conductor.

Review & Summary
Drift Speed of the Charge Carriers When an electric field
is established in a conductor, the charge carriers (assumed positive)
acquire a drift speed vd in the direction of the velocity is
related to the current density by
(26-7)
where ne is the carrier charge density.
Resistance of a Conductor The resistance R of a conductor
is defined as
(definition of R), (26-8)
where V is the potential difference across the conductor and i is the
current.The SI unit of resistance is the ohm (0): 1 0!1V/A.Similar
equations define the resistivity r and conductivity s of a material:
r ! (definitions of r and s), (26-12, 26-10)

possible to derive an expression for the resistivity of a metal:
(26-22)
Here n is the number of free electrons per unit volume and t is the
mean time between the collisions of an electron with the atoms of
the metal.We can explain why metals obey Ohm’s law by pointing
out that t is essentially independent of the magnitude E of any
electric field applied to a metal.
Power The power P, or rate of energy transfer, in an electrical
device across which a potential difference V is maintained is
P ! iV (rate of electrical energy transfer). (26-26)
Resistive Dissipation If the device is a resistor, we can write
Eq. 26-26 as
(resistive dissipation). (26-27, 26-28)
In a resistor, electric potential energy is converted to internal thermal
energy via collisions between charge carriers and atoms.
Semiconductors Semiconductors are materials that have few
conduction electrons but can become conductors when they are
doped with other atoms that contribute charge carriers.
Superconductors Superconductors are materials that lose all
electrical resistance at low temperatures. Some materials are superconducting
at surprisingly high temperatures.

at the rate of 200W. At what position x ! L should you cut the rod?


Emf An emf device does work on charges to maintain a potential
difference between its output terminals. If dW is the work the device
does to force positive charge dq from the negative to the positive terminal,
then the emf (work per unit charge) of the device is
(definition of #). (27-1)
The volt is the SI unit of emf as well as of potential difference.An ideal
emf device is one that lacks any internal resistance.The potential difference
between its terminals is equal to the emf. A real emf device
has internal resistance.The potential difference between its terminals
is equal to the emf only if there is no current through the device.
Analyzing Circuits The change in potential in traversing a
resistance R in the direction of the current is #iR; in the opposite
direction it is %iR (resistance rule).The change in potential in traversing
an ideal emf device in the direction of the emf arrow is %#;
in the opposite direction it is ## (emf rule). Conservation of
energy leads to the loop rule:
Loop Rule. The algebraic sum of the changes in potential encountered
in a complete traversal of any loop of a circuit must be zero.
Conservation of charge gives us the junction rule:
Junction Rule. The sum of the currents entering any junction
must be equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction.
Single-Loop Circuits The current in a single-loop circuit containing
a single resistance R and an emf device with emf # and internal
resistance r is
(27-4)
which reduces to i ! #/R for an ideal emf device with r ! 0.
Power When a real battery of emf # and internal resistance r
does work on the charge carriers in a current i through the battery,
the rate P of energy transfer to the charge carriers is
P ! iV, (27-14)

where V is the potential across the terminals of the battery.The rate
Pr at which energy is dissipated as thermal energy in the battery is
Pr ! i2r. (27-16)
The rate Pemf at which the chemical energy in the battery changes is
Pemf ! i#. (27-17)
Series Resistances When resistances are in series, they have
the same current. The equivalent resistance that can replace a series
combination of resistances is
(n resistances in series). (27-7)
Parallel Resistances When resistances are in parallel,
they have the same potential difference. The equivalent resistance
that can replace a parallel combination of resistances is given by
(n resistances in parallel). (27-24)
RC Circuits When an emf # is applied to a resistance R and capacitance
C in series, as in Fig. 27-15 with the switch at a, the charge
on the capacitor increases according to
q ! C#(1 # e#t/RC) (charging a capacitor), (27-33)
in which C#!q0 is the equilibrium (final) charge and RC!t is the capacitive
time constant of the circuit. During the charging, the current is
(charging a capacitor). (27-34)
When a capacitor discharges through a resistance R, the charge on
the capacitor decays according to
q ! q0e#t/RC (discharging a capacitor). (27-39)
During the discharging, the current is
i ! (discharging a capacitor). (27-40)

transfers energy to the resistors equal (a) 60.0W, (b) the maximum
possible rate Pmax, and (c) the minimum possible rate Pmin? What
are (d) Pmax and (e) Pmin?
Module 27-3 The Ammeter and
the Voltmeter
••49 (a) In Fig. 27-56, what current
does the ammeter read if
5.0 V (ideal battery), R1 ! 2.0 0, R2 !
4.0 0, and R3 ! 6.0 0? (b) The ammeter
and battery are now interchanged.
Show that the ammeter
reading is unchanged.
••50 In Fig. 27-57, R1 2.00R, the
ammeter resistance is zero, and the
battery is ideal.What multiple of #/R
gives the current in the ammeter?
••51 In Fig. 27-58, a voltmeter of
resistance RV ! 300 0 and an ammeter
of resistance RA ! 3.00 0 are
being used to measure a resistance
R in a circuit that also contains a resistance
R0 ! 100 0 and an ideal
battery with an emf of # ! 12.0 V.
Resistance R is given by R ! V/i,
where V is the potential across R
and i is the ammeter reading. The
voltmeter reading is V-, which is
V plus the potential difference
across the ammeter. Thus, the ratio
of the two meter readings is not R but only an apparent resistance
R- ! V-/i. If R ! 85.0 0, what are (a) the ammeter reading,
(b) the voltmeter reading, and (c) R-? (d) If RA is decreased,
does the difference between R- and R increase, decrease, or
remain the same?

battery in series with a resistance R and an ammeter that

Module 27-4 RC Circuits
•57 Switch S in Fig. 27-63 is closed at
time t ! 0, to begin charging an initially
uncharged capacitor of capacitance C !
15.0 mF through a resistor of resistance
R ! 20.0 0. At what time is the potential
across the capacitor equal to that across
the resistor?
•58 In an RC series circuit, emf # ! 12.0 V, resistance R !
1.40 M0, and capacitance C ! 1.80 mF. (a) Calculate the time constant.
(b) Find the maximum charge that will appear on the capacitor
during charging. (c) How long does it take for the charge to
build up to 16.0 mC?
•59 What multiple of the time constant t gives the time
taken by an initially uncharged capacitor in an RC series circuit to
be charged to 99.0% of its final charge?
•60 A capacitor with initial charge q0 is discharged through a
resistor. What multiple of the time constant t gives the time the
capacitor takes to lose (a) the first one-third of its charge and
(b) two-thirds of its charge?
•61 A 15.0 k0 resistor and a capacitor are connected in series,
and then a 12.0 V potential difference is suddenly applied
across them. The potential difference across the capacitor rises to
5.00 V in 1.30 ms. (a) Calculate the time constant of the circuit.
(b) Find the capacitance of the capacitor.
••62 Figure 27-64 shows the circuit of
a flashing lamp, like those attached to
barrels at highway construction sites.
The fluorescent lamp L (of negligible
capacitance) is connected in parallel
across the capacitor C of an RC circuit.
There is a current through the lamp
only when the potential difference
across it reaches the breakdown voltage
VL; then the capacitor discharges completely through the lamp
and the lamp flashes briefly. For a lamp with breakdown voltage
VL ! 72.0 V, wired to a 95.0 V ideal battery and a 0.150 mF capacitor,
what resistance R is needed for two flashes per second?
••63 SSM WWW In the circuit of Fig.
ILW
SSM
reads from 0 to 1.00 mA, as shown in
Fig. 27-59. Resistance R is adjusted
so that when the clip leads are
shorted together, the meter deflects
to its full-scale value of 1.00 mA.
What external resistance across the
leads results in a deflection of (a)
10.0%, (b) 50.0%, and (c) 90.0% of full scale? (d) If the ammeter
has a resistance of 20.0 0 and the internal resistance of the battery
is negligible, what is the value of R?
••53 In Fig. 27-14, assume that # ! 3.0 V, r ! 100 0, R1 ! 250 0,
and R2 ! 300 0. If the voltmeter resistance RV is 5.0 k0, what percent
error does it introduce into the measurement of the potential
difference across R1? Ignore the presence of the ammeter.
••54 When the lights of a car are
switched on, an ammeter in series with
them reads 10.0 A and a voltmeter
connected across them reads 12.0 V (Fig.
27-60).When the electric starting motor is
turned on, the ammeter reading drops to
8.00 A and the lights dim somewhat. If the
internal resistance of the battery is 0.0500
0 and that of the ammeter is negligible,
what are (a) the emf of the battery and (b)
the current through the starting motor
when the lights are on?
••55 In Fig. 27-61, Rs is to be adjusted in
value by moving the sliding contact across
it until points a and b are brought to the
same potential. (One tests for this condition by momentarily connecting
a sensitive ammeter between
a and b; if these points are at
the same potential, the ammeter
will not deflect.) Show that when
this adjustment is made, the following
relation holds: Rx ! RsR2/R1.
An unknown resistance (Rx) can be
measured in terms of a standard
(Rs) using this device, which is
called a Wheatstone bridge.
••56 In Fig. 27-62, a voltmeter of
resistance RV ! 300 0 and an ammeter
of resistance RA ! 3.00 0
are being used to measure a resistance
R in a circuit that also contains
a resistance R0 ! 100 0 and
an ideal battery of emf # ! 12.0 V.
Resistance R is given by R ! V/i,
where V is the voltmeter reading
and i is the current in resistance R.
However, the ammeter reading is
not i but rather i-, which is i plus the
current through the voltmeter.
Thus, the ratio of the two meter
readings is not R but only an appar-

time so that the steady state is reached. Then the switch is opened
at time t ! 0.What is the current in resistor 2 at t ! 4.00 ms?
••66 Figure 27-67 displays two circuits
with a charged capacitor that
is to be discharged through a resistor
when a switch is closed. In Fig.

time t do the two capacitors have the same charge?

after the connection is made, what is the rate at which (a) the
charge of the capacitor is increasing, (b) energy is being stored in
the capacitor, (c) thermal energy is appearing in the resistor, and
(d) energy is being delivered by the battery?
