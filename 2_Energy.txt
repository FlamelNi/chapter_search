Kinetic Energy The kinetic energy K associated with the motion
of a particle of mass m and speed v, where v is well below the
speed of light, is
(kinetic energy). (7-1)
Work Work W is energy transferred to or from an object via a
force acting on the object. Energy transferred to the object is positive
work, and from the object, negative work.
Work Done by a Constant Force The work done on a particle
by a constant force during displacement is
(work, constant force), (7-7, 7-8)
in which f is the constant angle between the directions of and .
Only the component of that is along the displacement can do
work on the object. When two or more forces act on an object,
their net work is the sum of the individual works done by the
forces, which is also equal to the work that would be done on the
object by the net force of those forces.
Work and Kinetic Energy For a particle, a change %K in the
kinetic energy equals the net work Wdone on the particle:

Review & Summary
in which Ki is the initial kinetic energy of the particle and Kf is the kinetic
energy after the work is done. Equation 7-10 rearranged gives us
Kf ! Ki " W. (7-11)
Work Done by the Gravitational Force The work Wg
done by the gravitational force on a particle-like object of mass
m as the object moves through a displacement is given by
Wg ! mgd cos f, (7-12)
in which f is the angle between and .
Work Done in Lifting and Lowering an Object The work
Wa done by an applied force as a particle-like object is either lifted
or lowered is related to the work Wg done by the gravitational
force and the change %K in the object’s kinetic energy by
%K ! Kf $ Ki ! Wa " Wg. (7-15)
If Kf ! Ki , then Eq. 7-15 reduces to
Wa!$Wg, (7-16)
which tells us that the applied force transfers as much energy to the
object as the gravitational force transfers from it.

Conservative Forces A force is a conservative force if the net
work it does on a particle moving around any closed path, from an
initial point and then back to that point, is zero. Equivalently, a
force is conservative if the net work it does on a particle moving
between two points does not depend on the path taken by the particle.
The gravitational force and the spring force are conservative
forces; the kinetic frictional force is a nonconservative force.
Potential Energy A potential energy is energy that is associated
with the configuration of a system in which a conservative force acts.
When the conservative force does work Won a particle within the system,
the change %Uin the potential energy of the system is
%U!$W. (8-1)
If the particle moves from point xi to point xf, the change in the
potential energy of the system is
(8-6)
Gravitational Potential Energy The potential energy associated
with a system consisting of Earth and a nearby particle is
gravitational potential energy. If the particle moves from height yi
to height yf, the change in the gravitational potential energy of the
particle–Earth system is
%U ! mg(yf $ yi) ! mg %y. (8-7)
If the reference point of the particle is set as yi ! 0 and the corresponding
gravitational potential energy of the system is set as
Ui ! 0, then the gravitational potential energy U when the parti-
%U ! $"xf

F(x) dx.
Review & Summary
cle is at any height y is
U(y) ! mgy. (8-9)
Elastic Potential Energy Elastic potential energy is the
energy associated with the state of compression or extension of an
elastic object. For a spring that exerts a spring force F!$kx when
its free end has displacement x, the elastic potential energy is
(8-11)
The reference configuration has the spring at its relaxed length, at
which x ! 0 and U ! 0.
Mechanical Energy The mechanical energy Emec of a system
is the sum of its kinetic energy K and potential energy U:
Emec ! K " U. (8-12)
An isolated system is one in which no external force causes energy
changes. If only conservative forces do work within an isolated system,
then the mechanical energy Emec of the system cannot change.
This principle of conservation of mechanical energy is written as
K2 " U2 ! K1 " U1, (8-17)
in which the subscripts refer to different instants during an
energy transfer process. This conservation principle can also be
written as
%Emec !%K"%U ! 0. (8-18)

conservation of energy, find the approximate
total distance that the cab will move before coming to rest.

cab is stationary.)
•••64 In Fig. 8-57, a block is released from rest at height d ! 40
cm and slides down a frictionless ramp and onto a first plateau,
which has length d and where the coefficient of kinetic friction is
0.50. If the block is still moving, it then slides down a second frictionless
ramp through height d/2 and onto a lower plateau, which
has length d/2 and where the coefficient of kinetic friction is
again 0.50. If the block is still moving, it then slides up a frictionless
ramp until it (momentarily) stops. Where does the block
stop? If its final stop is on a plateau, state which one and give the
distance L from the left edge of that plateau. If the block reaches
the ramp, give the height H above the lower plateau where it
momentarily stops.
